Variable Practice Question 4
Declare two variables as a and b. Initialize the values to those variables as 1042 and 7 respectively.

Declare another two variables quo and rem that will store the quotient and remainder of these numbers taking a as dividend and b as divisor.

Print quo and rem in a line separated by a space.

Input Format
No input. User has to declare the variables themselves.

Output Format
Print the quotient and remainder of these numbers by taking a as dividend and b as divisor.

Output:

148 6
