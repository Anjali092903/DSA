Circle Area-Perimeter
You are required to take the radius of a circle as input from the user, and finally, print the area and perimeter of the circle.

Note: Take pi as 3

Input Format
One line contains an integer number which is the radius of a circle.

Output Format
Print the area of the circle in the first line

Print the perimeter of the circle in the second line

Example 1
Input

4
Output

48
24
Explanation

pi * r * r = 48 and 2 * pi * r = 24, where r is the radius.

Example 2
Input

7
Output

147
42
